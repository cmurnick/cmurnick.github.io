I was lost on Monday. It was better on Tuesday.  We were working in for loops and then we took our HTML and made it into JS so we could easily add items. By Saturday, I was able to write a small program counting how any quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies were in our pocketbook.  It felt really good to see my progress and to feel the difference in my confidence.  I have a lot to learn, but every time I go to class I know more than the class before so I figure I’m going in the right direction. ",

I am going to ask for more practice projects to help solidify these concepts.  It’s been a month since school started and if I look backwards, I have learned so much.  Things that I was struggling with now come naturally.  I’m praying that JavaScript works the same way.  I’m waiting not so patiently for the lightbulb to go on. ",

Our group didn’t have a ton of merge conflicts because we planned well and each had our own CSS and JS files forour individual pages. We have a great group, so I feel like we did pretty well. We divided and conquered pretty well. We could have been more consistent on the styling of each page, but overall we did ok for our first group project.",

I’m glad I have the foundation of the long way; it makes me appreciate the shortcuts that jquery provides.  When it came to our group project, I’ve realized how important it is to plan things out.  It’s really important that the whole team is on the same page for coding and how the project will be structured.",

Sometimes it’s hard to get to the data and have it return what you’re looking for.  I’m getting better at it, but it’s still something I struggle with.  I’ve learned that the data structure is super important.",

It’s much easier than I thought it would be and works really with with Sublime.  I learned that it’s important to have the project looking exactly how you want it to locally before deploying it and how important it is to include all of the files in the public folder that the project needs to run.  Speaking of public folders, after I deployed our project from the Master branch, I’ve started to make a habit of grunt cleaning it right away so if I make changes I can see them locally.",

			"detail": "This was the first group project we had that we deployed to Firebase.  I learned how important is is for everyone to make sure that the API key isn’t pushed up on accident.  Our group worked really well together and we did the work equally.  As the project progressed, our teachers added more requirements.  I worked with a teammate and built upon the functionality that I did.  Though it was clunky, we got it working.  If I had more time, the functions would have been spread out in more than one function.  A real highlight was when something wasn’t working correctly, and I had the answer on how to fix it.  It showed me that I am really starting to understand the concepts.  I’m glad that I was in charge of deploying to Firebase.  It will really help having a better understanding of the application when it comes to my Capstone.",
